# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Dataset.  
I built a machine learning model (Random Forest) and evaluated it with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve.  

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy**: 83.6%  
- **Precision**: 78%  
- **Recall**: 97%  
- **F1 Score**: 86%
